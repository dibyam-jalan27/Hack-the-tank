# `StudyNotion - EdTech Website`

## _Description_

A web-based educational platform designed to provide students with interactive learning resources and tools to enhance their study experience.

### _Two-Tier User System_

StudyNotion incorporates a two-tier user system: instructors and students. Instructors possess the ability to create and manage courses, upload lesson videos, and curate engaging content for the website. Meanwhile, students can access these courses, learn from the videos, and develop their knowledge and skills.

### _Security Measures_

The platform employs several security measures, including the integration of **JWT tokens for authentication and authorization**. This ensures the secure access of users to platform resources. Additionally, an **email verification system** has been implemented, sending **OTPs** to user emails to enhance account security and reliability.

## _Responsibilities_

I took charge of developing the backend architecture, designing the database, and implementing server-side functionalities. I am currently focused on creating a responsive and user-friendly frontend.

## _Technologies Used_

- **Backend:** Express.JS
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Frontend:** Tailwind CSS, ReactJS
